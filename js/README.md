# Restaurant Reviews Stage 1

 This is an offline capable app for local restaurant reviews and information.

## Installing The App and Getting It Loaded to Browser:

1. Clone the to repo in your terminal using the $ git clone command. The code was provided by                                    Udacity:https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.

2. In your terminal use Python to open up a local server: $ php -S localhost:8000.

3. Open up the localhost:8000 in Chrome or your favorite browser.

4. This project requires an API token for the map. Use google maps or mapbox. I used mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com) it is        free to get the token.

5. Further instructions on how to get through this project are located in the READ.md in the cloned repo.
